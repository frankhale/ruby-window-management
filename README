This code is released under the GNU GPL version 3

To build the extension at a command prompt type:

cd src
ruby extconf.rb 
make

cd ../examples

Now you can run any of the examples. You can use Xnest to run the window
managers.

NOTE: The examples should be able to be ran in place. No need to install anything.
